
REQUIREMENTS (SaLoMon)

    The SaLoMon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell, which is
    the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least Linux
    distributions).

    So, no matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell must be installed
    in order to use SaLoMon.

    Additional package requirements:

        - coreutils (version 2.85 or higher is recommended)
        - grep (version 2.18 or higher is recommended)
        - sed (version 2.50 or higher is recommended)
        
    Optional package requirements:
    
        - dialog (version 1.1 or higher is recommended)

    All the recommended versions of the required utilities mentioned above are
    the ones that have been used while developing SaLoMon. The project also
    works most likely with earlier versions.
