
REQUIREMENTS (SaLoMon)

    The SaLoMon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell, which is
    is the default shell on many *Unix*-like systems (or at least *Linux*
    distributions).
    
    So, no matter which shell you are using, the *Bash* shell must be installed
    in order to use *SaLoMon*.
    
    Additional package requirements:

        - grep (version 2.18 or higher is recommended)
        - sed (version 2.50 or higher is recommended)
        - tail (version 2.81 or higher is recommended)

    Usually, the "tail" utility is part of the "coreutils" package.

    All the recommended versions of the utilities mentioned above are the ones
    that have been used while developing SaLoMon. The project may also work
    with earlier versions.
