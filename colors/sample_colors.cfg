#  SaLoMon sample color configuration file for highlighting lines which      #
#  contain a certain term.                                                   #
#                                                                            #
#  SaLoMon uses a first hit ruleset design. This means that the first rule   #
#  that applies will be used.                                                #
#                                                                            #
#  The given terms will be processed case-insensitive and must neither       #
#  contain spaces nor quotes. Furthermore, there must be a seperate rule     #
#  for each term (multiple terms per rule are not supported).                #
#                                                                            #
#  Depending on the color settings of the shell, the colors may vary or the  #
#  dark and light colors are identical, but the text may be bold.            #
#                                                                            #
#  You can either choose from 16 pre-defined color names or give a number    #
#  between 1 and 256 (including both) to use a 256-color palette. Details    #
#  about the numbers and the corresponding colors can be found inside the    #
#  SaLoMon wiki (https://github.com/urbanware-org/salomon/wiki).             #
