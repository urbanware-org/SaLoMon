#  Included SaLoMon sample color configuration file for highlighting lines   #
#  which contain a certain term.                                             #
#                                                                            #
#  The given terms will be processed case-insensitive and must neither       #
#  contain spaces nor quotes. Furthermore, there must be a seperate rule     #
#  for each term (multiple terms per rule are not supported).                #
#                                                                            #
#  Depending on the color settings of the shell, the colors may vary or the  #
#  dark and light colors are identical, but the text may be bold.            #
#                                                                            #
#  You can either choose from 16 pre-defined color names (see below) or      #
#  give a number between 1 and 256 (including both) to use a 256-color       #
#  palette.                                                                  #
#                                                                            #
#  Details about the numbers and the corresponding colors can either be      #
#  printed on the shell by running SaLoMon with the '--color-table'          #
#  command-line argument or found inside the SaLoMon wiki:                   #
#                                                                            #

# Example 1:
#
#   Lines containing the term "fail" shall be highlighted red,
#   lines containing the term "warn" shall be highlighted yellow and
#   lines containing the term "success" shall be highlighted green
#
lightred    fail
yellow      warn
lightgreen  success

# Example 2:
#
#   Lines containing the term "notice" or "info" shall be highlighted
#   blue.
#
lightblue   notice
lightblue   info

# Example 3 (using the 256-color palette):
#
#   Lines containing the term "important" shall be highlighted orange.
#
208         important

# Example 4:
#
#   Different colors for the same term or different colors for multiple terms
#   in the same line do not cause any errors, however the behavior is a little
#   bit special.
#
#   The terms inside the color config file are being parsed alphabetically by
#   the color names (black, brown, darkblue, darkcyan, darkgray, darkgreen,
#   darkpurple, darkred, lightblue, lightcyan, lightgray, lightgreen,
#   lightpurple, lightred, yellow, and white).
#
#   For example, if you have the following line
#
#       2014-04-02 01:04:34 Warning: At least one process has failed
#
#   with the following color definitions the line will be highlighted in
#   blue.
#
yellow      warning
lightred    failed
lightblue   process

# EOF
