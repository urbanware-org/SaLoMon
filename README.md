## Definition

The *SaLoMon* project is a simple log file monitor and analyzer with various filter and highlighting features which can also be used with other plain text files. 

## Details

The main script was primarily built to monitor and analyze log as well as plain text files on systems without a graphical user interface. It returns either all or just certain lines (by applying a filter) that have been added to the monitored file.

These lines can also easily be colorized with user-defined colors (and additionally highlighted) depending on given criteria. For example, all lines which contain the word "error" can be displayed red.

## Usage

### Simple example

You can see a simple usage example inside the wiki.

### Documentation files
