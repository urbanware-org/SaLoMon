## Definition

The *SaLoMon* project is a simple log file monitor and analyzer with various filter and highlighting features which can also be used with other plain text files.

[Top](#salomon-)

## Details

<img src="https://github.com/urbanware-org/salomon/blob/master/wiki/salomon_output.png" alt="SaLoMon sample output" width=320px align="right"/>The project was primarily built to log and analyze log files inside a terminal emulator and also on systems without a graphical user interface. However, it can also be used to process other text-based files.

These lines can also easily be colorized with user-defined colors (and additionally highlighted in different ways) depending on given criteria. For example, all lines which contain the word "error" can be displayed red (as shown above). Fruthermore the output can be filtered to only return certain lines instead of all.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urbanware-org/salomon/master/wiki/salomon_dialog_inputfile.png" alt="SaLoMon interactive dialog" align="right"/>There are various additional combinable features, for example giving a filter, exclude and remove pattern to filter and customize the output.

Furthermore, as you can see on the right, there is the option to use interactive dialogs instead of or in combination with command-line arguments which is useful when e. g. running *SaLoMon* via shortcut in a terminal window on a graphical user interface.

## Requirements

The *SaLoMon* project was developed on (and for) the *Bash* shell, which is the default shell on many *Unix*-like systems (or at least *Linux* distributions).

Furthermore, it uses popular shell utilities that should be pre-installed by default, see the included `REQUIREMENTS` file for details.

## Support the project

You do not need to be a software developer to support and improve the *SaLoMon* project.

For example, if you have created a color config file for a log file which you want to share, you can send it to me so I can add it to the color config files distributed with *SaLoMon*.

This also applies to suggestions, requests and improvements for color config files.
