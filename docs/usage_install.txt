    1. Definition

        The SaLoMon installation script allows to install or uninstall the
        project automatically.

    2. General stuff

        2.1 Overview of all command-line arguments

            Usually, to get an overview of all arguments available, you simply
            have run the script with the '--help' argument, but there is no
            such feature for this install script.

            Running it without any arguments will install SaLoMon and running
            it with the argument '--uninstall' will remove the project again.

            Details can be found below.

        2.2 Important notice

            The SaLoMon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell,
            which is the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least
            Linux distributions).

            No matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell must be
            installed in order to use SaLoMon.

            Please read the included documentation related to the shell
            compatibility before using SaLoMon.

    3. Install SaLoMon

        Notice that this process requires superuser privileges.

        The project will be installed to '/opt/salomon' and a symbolic link to
        its main script will be created in '/usr/local/bin' by default. If the
        directory '/usr/local/bin' does not exist, the symbolic link will be
        created inside '/usr/bin' instead.

        Now, to install, type one of the following commands (all of them have
        the same effect).

            # ./install.sh
            # ./install.sh -i
            # ./install.sh --install

    4. Run the installed SaLoMon

        After installing SaLoMon, it can simply be run by typing its name in
        lowercase followed by the arguments to use. For example:

            $ salomon --help

    5. Uninstall SaLoMon

        Notice that this process requires superuser privileges.

        To uninstall the project, type one of the following commands (both of
        them have the same effect).

            # ./install.sh -u
            # ./install.sh --uninstall
