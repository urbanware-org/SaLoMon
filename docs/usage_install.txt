    1. Definition

        The SaLoMon installation script allows to install or uninstall the
        project, which is optional and not necessary in order to use it.

    2. General stuff

        2.1 Overview of all command-line arguments

            The script requires command-line arguments to operate. You can get
            an overview of all arguments available, by simply running the main
            script with the '--help' argument.

            Running it without any arguments will implicitly install SaLoMon
            and running it explicitly with the argument '--uninstall' will
            remove the project again.

            Details can be found below.

        2.2 Important notice

            The SaLoMon project was developed on (and for) the Bash shell,
            which is the default shell on many Unix-like systems (or at least
            on many Linux distributions).

            No matter which shell you are using, the Bash shell must be
            installed in order to use the project.

            Please read the included documentation related to the shell
            compatibility before using SaLoMon.

    3. Install SaLoMon

        Notice that this process requires superuser privileges.

        The project will be installed to '/opt/salomon' and a symbolic link to
        its main script will be created in '/usr/local/bin' by default. If the
        directory '/usr/local/bin' does not exist, the symbolic link will be
        created inside '/usr/bin' instead.

        Now, to install, type one of the following commands, depending on the
        way you prefer.

        Either as normal user via 'sudo'

            $ sudo ./install.sh

        or directly when logged in as root:

            # ./install.sh

    4. Run the installed SaLoMon

        After installing SaLoMon, it can simply be run by typing its name in
        lowercase (without a trailing '.sh') followed by the arguments to use.
        For example:

            $ salomon --help

    5. Uninstall SaLoMon

        Notice that this process also requires superuser privileges.

        Either as normal user via 'sudo'

            $ sudo ./install.sh -u

        or directly when logged in as root:

            # ./install.sh -u
